* And his [blog post](http://blog.mixu.net/2011/02/02/essential-node-js-patterns-and-snippets/) on patterns
* [Javascript - The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-ebook/dp/B00IG20OBY). The best $10 you'll ever spend, period.
* [Node.js API Docs](http://nodejs.org/api/) - These are not your typical API docs, they are actually not a bad read. Complete with code examples
* [Node.js Production Practices](http://www.joyent.com/developers/node/deploy)

###Read the Source Code - Popular Projects
* [Express.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) - Think [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/), in Javascript.
* [Grunt.js](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt) - Task runner, fits the same role as Rake or Thor in a Rails project
